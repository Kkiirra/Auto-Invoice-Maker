The essence of this project is to keep an automatic record of your company.

On the site you can create your company and link your account to it, as well as integrate your bank account from 8 popular banks in Poland. (Thanks NordigenAPI)

Once your bank account is integrated, a company and an account will be created and subsequently linked to your profile and all transactions from your bank account will be uploaded to the site and contractors will be created.

You can then keep track of your invoices/orders, which will automatically be linked to your transactions.

The transaction page provides the function of uploading new transactions and automatic binding to the invoice by Company-Account-Contractor-Amount parameters, also the manual binding functionality is provided, if some parameters conflict, the system recommends them, but does not automatically bind.

Also, together with the binding of transactions to orders, there are signals that change the status of the Invoice depending on the amount of bound transactions.
